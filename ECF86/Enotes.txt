You can't have two rooks sharing the same column and then two rooks sharing the same row. This means that your total # of columns covered is < n and same w rows, so find (i, j) and that square can't be attacked.

Assume all rooks are on distinct rows. Find answer, mult by 2, subtract permutations.

Think about distributing edges among line of nodes. # of connected components is the same in each case, so you will have to multiply by same multinomial coeff for col orders.

Perhaps count # ways of distributing k edges w dp.

Obs: if we have n nodes and k edges, we KNOW there are n-k components. So this above # is equiv to distributing n distinguishable objects into n-k boxes s.t. each box gets at least one elt. Stirling numbers of second kind.

So ans is {n, n-k}*(n choose n-k). Then mult by 2. Handle k = 0 case separately.
